# WeatherPie
This is an android application for reading my local weather station data from NodeMCU, BMP pressure, Temperatur and light sensors.
The data is being uploaded at a regular interval to thingspeak.com
This app is just reading the data using the public URL and parsing the JSON to print the data in it.
You can just change the URLS and Fields to display your own data.

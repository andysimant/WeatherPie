# WeatherPie
This is the android application for reading my local weather station data from NodeMCU, BMP pressure, Temperatur and light sensors.
The data is being uploaded at a regular interval to thingspeak.com
This app is just reading the data using the public URL and parsing the JSON to print the data in it.
